I am an Assistant Professor in the Truman School of Government and Public Affairs at University of Missouri.

I study comparative political behavior, the politics of immigrant integration, and political representation. I have a special interest in time series and pooled times series analysis. 

My current research interests focus on immigrant-origin political behavior, particularly refugees and asylum-seekers, attitudes towards these groups, as well as the effects of women's representation. 

My work has been published in journals such as Political Science Research and Methods, Polity, Social Science Quarterly and Legislative Studies Quarterly. I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from University of Colorado Boulder.

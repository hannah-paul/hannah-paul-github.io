*Objectives*: Despite the frequent use of time series models in the social sciences, they have often remained within the confines of assuming purely linear dynamic effects. We contend that many theories involve relationships that are inherently non-linear. *Methods*: We discuss several approaches to modeling a variety of these types of non-linear autoregressive data-generating processes, specifically threshold effects. *Results*: We replicate and extend a recent analysis, and show evidence of threshold processes. *Conclusion*: In doing so, we show that threshold models allow us to test richer, more complex theoretical implications about dynamic effects.

<div id="BlockName3" class="collapse">  

Machine learning models, especially ensemble and tree-based approaches, offer great promise to legislative scholars. However, they are heavily underutilized outside of narrow applications to text and networks. We believe this is because they are difficult to interpret: while the models are extremely flexible, they have been criticized as "black box" techniques due to their difficulty in visualizing the effect of predictors on the outcome of interest. In order to make these models more useful for legislative scholars, we introduce a framework integrating machine learning models with traditional parametric approaches. We then review three interpretative plotting strategies that scholars can use to bring a substantive interpretation to their machine learning models. For each, we explain the plotting strategy, when to use it, and how to interpret it. We then put these plots in action by revisiting two recent articles from *Legislative Studies Quarterly*.

<div id="BlockName4" class="collapse">  

Decades of research has debated whether women first need to reach a "critical mass" in the legislature before they can effectively influence legislative outcomes. This study contributes to the debate using supervised tree-based machine learning to study the relationship between increasing variation in women's legislative representation and the allocation of government expenditures in three policy areas: education, healthcare, and defense. We find that women's representation predicts spending in all three areas. We also find evidence of critical mass effects as the relationships between women's representation and government spending are nonlinear. However, beyond critical mass, our research points to a potential critical mass interval or critical limit point in women's representation. We offer guidance on how these results can inform future research using standard parametric models.

<div id="BlockName" class="collapse">  

Issue salience is an important dimension of public opinion and democratic politics. When mass publics are deeply concerned about particular societal issues, they can shape political debates, contests, agendas, and outcomes. Given the shifting politicization of certain issues in advanced democracies and the heightened importance of people's issue positions for their vote choices, fresh insights into the dynamics of issue salience are increasingly valuable. A review of existing research reveals that we have a great deal to learn about the way salience emerges and shifts among regular people in democratic societies. Using seventeen waves of panel survey data from Germany, we find that being an immigrant affects how concerning one finds certain issues (the economy in general and immigration to Germany) but not others (such as crime in Germany). When we take time seriously and model change, we find that where salience gaps existed between native Germans and immigrants at the start of the survey, they weaken progressively for public issues.

<div id="BlockName6" class="collapse">  

Political trust is a foundational attitude for other political attitudes and forms of political engagement. With over 27 million refugees worldwide, and pressure on established democracies to engage in more resettlement, we consider what causes a resettled refugee to become more trusting of their political leaders. We challenge existing theories on the importance of policy outcomes, arguing instead that people with forced migration backgrounds are more oriented to use evaluations of the character of political leaders in establishing trustworthiness. To test this hypothesis, we use an original survey experiment administered to a sample of Bhutanese refugees resettled in Michigan. Our results show that resettled refugees who read a personalized information presentation about Governor Gretchen Whitmer become more trusting of her compared to participants in the control group. While modest in the size of its effect, this finding suggests that resettled refugees use character evaluations to inform their political attitudes.

<div id="BlockName5" class="collapse">  

What pathways do resettled refugees take become included in the politics of their new home countries? I examine refugee political integration through the lens of political party support using a panel survey of resettled refugees in Germany. I find that attending a state-run integration course increases the likelihood of supporting a political party and that host country language learning mediates this relationship. This research contributes to ongoing debates about political engagement and refugee integration by showing that the state has a role to play in incorporating newcomers into democratic life through integration courses. These findings inform our understanding of ways to accommodate the political integration of growing refugee populations across countries in Europe, North America, and other refugee-receiving democracies.

Why does support for immigrants vary? I argue that natural empathy, as opposed to solicited empathy, is an important explanation for opinion formation about immigrants. Using a cross-section of data from the Swedish Political Socialization Panel survey, I find that empathetic individuals are more likely to report supportive attitudes toward immigrants compared to those with lower levels of natural empathy. I explore the possibility that that support for left leaning parties mediates empathy's positive association with support for immigrants, given empirical work which shows a link between empathy and ideological liberalism. Using a causal mediation analysis, I show that support for left leaning parties only partially explains the positive relationship between empathy and support for immigrants, and that the direct effect of empathy is much larger. This study contributes to our understanding of people's attitudes about immigrants by revealing the importance of people's psychological traits in forming attitudes about societal groups.

<div id="BlockName10" class="collapse">  

What explains attitudes towards outgroups? Existing research demonstrates that it is more difficult to cultivate support for an outgroup than to foster opposition. Examining refugees as an outgroup, I use an experimental design to test the effects of refugee narratives at different levels of personalization on peopleâ€™s political attitudes. Extant work suggests that the frames used to describe immigrants influence peopleâ€™s attitudes about them, suggesting that positive, personal frames should foster favorable attitudes toward this outgroup. In contrast to these theoretical implications, I find that adding and increasing the level of personalization in a description of refugee migration does not cause people to become more empathetic toward or supportive of refugees in their attitudes or behavior. These findings bear important implications for how we understand stereotype disruption and for NGOsâ€™ strategies to foster more support for immigrants and refugees. My findings suggest that personalizing language may not be as useful as previously thought and invites scholars of attitudes about refugees and refugees advocates to reconsider specific approaches to fostering support for refugees.

<div id="BlockName9" class="collapse">  

Refugees face a number of challenges to successful integration, including hostility from the members of their increasingly polarized host country (Tesler 2021). While research points to empathy as a useful tool for cultivating supportive attitudes toward refugees, the political science literature remains unclear about the conditions under which empathy has pro-social effects, specifically with regard to racial dynamics. In this study, we test whether people are biased regard ing which resettled refugees they experience empathy for. Does empathy allow people to overcome their racial in-group preferences, or does it magnify them? To assess this question, we administer a web experiment to a sample of 50 percent Black and 50 percent white U.S. Citizens that is nationally representative of the characteristics within each group. Half of the respondents are primed to consider refugees who share their racial in-group and half are primed to consider their racial out-group when evaluating their support for refugees. We measure respondents' level of parochial empathy to determine the extent to which respondents feel more empathy towards refugees who share their race, and if those differences in empathy change how supportive they are towards refugees. We expect that we will observe a racial in-group preference amongst white respondents, but will not observe this same preference amongst Black respondents, conditional on the degree of parochial empathy the respondent exhibit
